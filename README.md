# Goose Bot

## This is a Development Build
This branch of this project is the development build of goose-bot. It represents the current state of the project and any instability, crashes, or bugs that may come with it. In fact there's a good chance this branch won't even compile. For a known working version of the bot head over to the "main" branch and use that codebase instead.
